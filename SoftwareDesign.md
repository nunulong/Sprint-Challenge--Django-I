# Software design pattern

My favorite software design pattern is Module. I realize that modularization of the software is
important when developing the complex application. There are several reasons I like this design pattern:

1.  the reusability of the components or modules will reduce lots of development time

2.  modularization of project is very easy to maintain or scale the project for a long term run

3.  modularizaiton of project will separate the project to different parts so that different teams could get involved in the project at the same time, which will improve the collaboration and speed up the development process.

One of anti-pattern I have run into is spaghetti code. When I first learned programming using C. I didn't know how to organize my codes and structure the project I made. I just threw all the codes in one file and made me hard to refactor the code. At that time, I even didn't care how to write clean code. As I keep learning software engineering and programming, I gradually learn how to write clean code and how to structure the project in professional fashion.
